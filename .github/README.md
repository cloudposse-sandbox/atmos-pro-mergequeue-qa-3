Example application deployed to AWS ECS using [Atmos](https://atmos.tools) and [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org).

This repository demonstrates an elegant, self-contained approach to deploying containerized applications on ECS Fargate with automated CI/CD pipelines.


## Introduction

### Application

A simple Go web server designed to demonstrate container deployment strategies. Each request increments a counter, and the background color is configurable - making it easy to visualize blue/green deployments and load balancing. The `/dashboard` endpoint displays a grid of auto-refreshing iframes to show traffic distribution across instances. See [`app/`](app/) for details.

### Infrastructure

This project uses:

- **[Atmos](https://atmos.tools)** - Configuration orchestration and stack management
- **[OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org)** - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform-compatible)
- **AWS ECS Fargate** - Serverless container orchestration
- **AWS ECR** - Container image registry
- **AWS EFS** - Persistent file storage (optional)



## Usage

### Local Development

Run the application locally using Podman Compose:

```bash
# Start the app locally (builds and runs on http://localhost:8080)
atmos up

# Stop the app
atmos down
```

### CI/CD Workflows

See [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/) for detailed workflow diagrams.

| Workflow | Trigger | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `feature-branch.yml` | PR, merge queue | Build image, run tests, deploy preview (PR with `deploy` label), deploy dev (merge queue gate) |
| `validate.yml` | PR, merge queue | Lint CODEOWNERS |
| `main-branch.yaml` | Push to `main` | Update draft release notes |
| `release.yaml` | Published release, manual dispatch | Promote image, deploy to staging and/or prod |
| `preview-cleanup.yml` | PR closed | Destroy preview environment |

### Deployment

#### Prerequisites

- [Atmos](https://atmos.tools/install) installed
- [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/) installed
- AWS credentials configured

#### Infrastructure Dependencies

Before deploying, you must have the following infrastructure deployed:

1. **VPC** - With public/private subnets
2. **ECS Cluster** - With an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and DNS records configured
3. **EFS** (optional) - For persistent storage volumes

Then configure the dependencies in `terraform/stacks/`. You have two options:

**Option 1: Use `!terraform.state` (recommended)**

Update the dependency configurations in `terraform/stacks/deps/` to point to your infrastructure's remote state:
- `deps/vpc.yaml` - VPC component remote state location
- `deps/ecs.yaml` - ECS cluster component remote state location
- `deps/efs.yaml` - EFS component remote state location (if using volumes)

**Option 2: Hardcode values (brownfield)**

Replace the `!terraform.state` lookups in `terraform/stacks/defaults/app.yaml` with hardcoded values for your infrastructure. See [`terraform/stacks/defaults/README.md`](terraform/stacks/defaults/README.md) for required variables and a complete example.

#### Local Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to dev environment
atmos terraform deploy app -s dev

# Deploy to staging
atmos terraform deploy app -s staging

# Deploy to production
atmos terraform deploy app -s prod
```

#### CI/CD Deployment

1. Open a PR → CI runs build and tests; add the `deploy` label to deploy a preview environment.
2. Approve and click "Merge when ready" → the merge queue runs build, tests, and `atmos terraform deploy app -s dev` before fast-forwarding `main` to the queue commit.
3. Publish a GitHub release → automatically deploys to staging, then prod.
4. Manually dispatch the release workflow with a `tag` and `environment` → redeploy a previous version (rollback or hotfix) without cutting a new release.

See [`.github/workflows/README.md`](workflows/README.md) for design rationale and detailed sequence diagrams.

### Configuration

Stack configurations are in `terraform/stacks/`. Each environment imports shared defaults and specifies environment-specific settings:

```yaml
# terraform/stacks/dev.yaml
import:
  - _default.yaml
  - defaults/app.yaml
  - deps/*

vars:
  stage: dev
```

Container configuration is defined in `terraform/stacks/defaults/app.yaml` and can be customized per environment.
